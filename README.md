<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> This project is related to (<a href="https://github.com/unimer/Static-DataVis/blob/master/StaticInfoVis.pdf" target="_blank">IOTOK</a>) interactive series about latest inhabitants of Island Bri≈°evo in Croatia. My idea was to put myself in position of YouTube content creator and answer some quiestions using data visualization techniquies, which would give me idea about audience and make base for further tactics for making and posting YouTube videos. Purpose of this projcet is to show the process of creating static data visualization. It includes analysis of visual primitives, visual variables, color palattes, dataset and data transformation and manipulation and filtering that are used. The final goal is to show static graphs which whill be easy observable and self explanatory. </p> <a href="https://github.com/unimer/Static-DataVis/blob/master/StaticInfoVis.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a>
